New Features Comming Soon!

-Pheromons

    -Cells can emmit pheromones using their cell response mechanism. They can control the spread, velocity, color, and duration of each pheromone.

    -Pheromon Map: each chunk in th map will be contain the avrage inside and outline color inside that chunk. The information in each chunk will be given to the cells "brain".
